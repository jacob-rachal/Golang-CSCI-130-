Hello there, I am Jacob Rachal.
The purpose of this text file is to let you know that the picture that you see when you run this program is not
the same one that was provided by the instructor for the class.  For some reason, the version I had (surf.jpeg)
was corrupted. So, I went ahead and found another picture that I could use.
  And then I had to find another one because the one I had chosen was too big in size. Fancy that.
